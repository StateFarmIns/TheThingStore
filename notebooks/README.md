# Example Project

Welcome to the Thing Store! Some people find the ideas which lurk behind the Thing Store more challenging to absorb to and grasp but at heart they are very simple.

In order to understand what the ThingStore is, and how to use it, this series of Notebooks creates a sample project and then demonstrates how to use the ThingStore, and some accompanying standard Data Science tools, to do some neat stuff.
