# The Thing Store

The Thing Store is a **singular** Thing, though with a set expectation of structure.

This Thing (Thing Store) has a single dataset *describing* each of the (n) Things it contains. This dataset collects all metadata elements for all Things within the ThingStore and is known as the *metadata dataset*.

This Thing has an accompanying embedding matrix of dimensionality (n, d) which is correlated with the metadata dataset.

This Thing has a non-trivially complex set of corresponding artifacts representing the contents which it manages.

The specific implementation is immaterial.
