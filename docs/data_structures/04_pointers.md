# Thing Pointer

Almost everything in the Thing Store can also be 'This thing over here' or 'that thing over there'.

The FILEID is sufficiently descriptive to allow unique globally accessible information and identification via a descriptive name.

Translation: You do not need to copy that data again, and again, and again.

This is future state.
