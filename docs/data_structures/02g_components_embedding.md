# Component Expectations

The ThingStore manages a set of Things, each of which has component level expectations.

## Embedding

A Thing can have an Embedding, meaning that it has an associated two-dimensional embedded vector representation.

Please take a look at the [embedding notebook](../../notebooks/EmbeddedThing.ipynb) for a very simple introduction to storing tensors within the Thing Store
