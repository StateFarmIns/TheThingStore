# Thing

A 'Thing' can be any information, but for the purposes of intelligent automation a Thing is a formal data structure which can potentially have [**very specific** properties / components](docs\data_structures\02a_components.md):

A 'Thing *Store*' is a formal data structure which has one or more Things, potentially dependent on one another.

[Any given Thing can be viewed as a singular node within a larger graph (or a graph with one node...)](docs\data_structures\03_graphs.md)
